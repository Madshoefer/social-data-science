# Fundamentals of Social Data Science in Python Assessment

**Module overview:** The module covers the following key themes:

- Data science as a technique for abstraction
- Python as a means to manage large data sets
- The web as unstructured data that must be transformed into structured data
- Multiple languages and packages are required for data science
- Importance of data wrangling choices to research validity

**Courswork:** For the courseowkr of this module, I decided to analyse whether and how governmental measures taken to combat COVID-19 have been effective in preventing health and economic crises. To do so, I joined mobility data, data on government restriction, and data on stock markets and other economic indicators and subsequently ran exploratory data analysis and created visuals that aid the understanding of the data.
