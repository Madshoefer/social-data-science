# SDS Thesis Repository

This repository stores code necessary for my postgraduate Thesis as part of the MSc in Social Data Science at the Oxford Internet institute. It stores the following material:

- [Amazon Web-Scraper](Amazon_BSR_Webscraper.py)
- Data Analysis Code (to be added)
- Data Visualisation Code (to be added)


## Amazon Web-Scraper

The web-scraper is the data collection source for my thesis project and systematically goes through the following process:

- Scrape the Amazon Best Seller Rank list for 20 product categories
- Scrape the Frequently Bought Together (FBT) recommended products for each product on the best seller rank list
- Scrape the best seller ranks, product identification numbers, and seller status for all products on the best seller rank list as well as their FBT recommended products
