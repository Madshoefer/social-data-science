## Machine Learning

**Module overview:** The module covers the following key themes:

- Supervised and unsupervised machine learning
- Regression and classification
- Overfitting and regularization
- Support vector machines and tree-based methods (random forests, boosting)
- Gaussian Processes and Expectation-Maximization
- Variational inference and optimization
- Neural networks and deep learning

**Courswork:** The assessment for this course has been a 7-day long take-home exam, which may be found in a [separate pdf](Instructions.pdf).
