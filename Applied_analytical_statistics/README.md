# Applied Analytical Statistics Assessment

**Module overview:** The module has the following key learning objectives:

- Understanding of the types of statistical tools available to students to enable them to answer social research questions
- Understanding of how to describe quantitative data
- Regression models and interpret the output
- Present the results of regression models in research papers

During the course, students will make use of the Python programming language, and hence build familiarity with the language as they progress through the course, particularly some typical libraries for the analysis and display of data such as Pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib.

**Coursework:** I devoted my coursework for this module to empirically assess the effect of income changes on happiness levels. As such, I investigated the individual utility model based on income comparisons proposed by Clark and Frijters (2008) as a response to a paradox introduced by Easterlin (1974), namely that increases in individual income increase individual happiness, but that increases in average income do not increase average happiness. The paper lays out four hypotheses related to Clark and Frijters (2008): (1) increases in absolute income increase individual happiness, prone to adaptation and diminishing returns, (2) increases in relative income enduringly increase individual happiness with diminishing returns, (3) as a consequence of (1)-(2) distributional GDP growth changes average happiness levels, and (4) several predictors beyond individual income (absolute or relative) exist that affect happiness. The empirical application of Clark and Frijtersâ€™ (2008) utility model includes a cross-sectional analysis via multiple linear regression, and a longitudinal analysis via a synthetic control method, the results of which largely support the hypotheses to be tested.
