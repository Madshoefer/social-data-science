# Applied Analytical Statistics Assessment

The main task of the assessment is to demonstrate that students can apply analytical statistics to answer a social science research question. In order to do this, students should choose a research question and data which can be used to address the question, and design and implement an analysis. Students are encouraged to use some of the analytical techniques specifically taught in class, though application of other techniques is acceptable if appropriate for the question. We would strongly encourage the students to use an already existing dataset for their analysis rather than spending time on data collection. The use of novel datasets is permitted; however, no extra marks will be given for data novelty.  

Students will be asked to submit a short description of their proposed question and project in week 4 and will receive feedback on its suitability.

#### In their maximum 5,000-word project report, students should include the following elements:

- Introduction. Describe an analytical research question with reference to existing literature on the subject. We do not expect an extensive literature review but students will be rewarded for clearly linking their question to a body of theory to be tested. In particular, students are encouraged to develop specific hypotheses related to the question they will be testing
- Methods. Report on the type of analysis used to address the research question. Describe the dataset, including general notes on how it was collected and specific descriptive statistics of interest.
- Results. Give the necessary results needed to answer the research question. At this point avoiding discussing the results or linking them with the existing literature. 
- Discussion. Draw conclusions and thus answer the research question.  Discuss the limitations of the analysis.

Code for the project can be submitted as an appendix, which does not count towards the 5,000-word limit.
